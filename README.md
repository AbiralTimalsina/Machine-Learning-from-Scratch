Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms built from the ground up using Python. The focus is on understanding core concepts without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow (except for basic utilities like NumPy). Each implementation includes explanations and code comments to help grasp the underlying mechanics of ML models.

Features:
Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, PCA, etc.)
Neural Networks (Basic Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron)
Optimization Techniques (Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent)
Evaluation Metrics and Utility Functions
Ideal for learners who want to deepen their understanding of machine learning by building algorithms from scratch.
